<p> My name is Bryan Schonhaut and I am the architect of this site. I created this place to serve as an extension of myself and my work, allowing me to take what I’ve done and give it life.
.</p>
 <p class="ex1"> I love nothing more than to create and build works of my own design and watch them execute perfectly. I love planning events for my fraternity and carrying them out precisely as I had envisioned. I took great pleasure from the feeling of earning over $6,000 for my High School Hook Line and Sinker Club, through selling popcorn alone. I was completely enthralled at the prospect of designing my own website, where I would be able to see the results of my University’s coding class.</p>
 <p class="ex1">My father would often refer to me as a “Jack of all trades”. I’m an intern, a planner, an instructor, a programmer, a writer and even a victim advocate, all rolled into one quasi-magnificent form.</p>
